# 🌍 GlobalExchangeAPI 🚧 [IN DEVELOPMENT]

> *Building the ultimate global currency & country data API*

## 🎯 What We're Building

A robust REST API that aggregates country data and currency exchange rates to provide calculated economic insights.

```
External APIs → Data Processing → Database → API Responses
     ↓               ↓               ↓           ↓
Countries API  → Extract currencies → MySQL → Filtered/Sorted
Exchange API  → Calculate GDP     → Cache  → Formatted JSON
```
